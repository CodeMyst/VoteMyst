    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>
        You are permitted to review and request removal of your personalised data. 
        All data we store is shown on your profile and can be reviewed there. 
        Removal of data is done by deleting your account on your profile. 
        When uploading content to this service you give us unrestricted non-retractable rights to use, distribute, alter, and display your content. 
        Because this service is public use we cannot guarantee your content will not be copied by other users. As such we cannot be held liable in the event this happens.

    <h1>Privacy</h1>

    <p>What personalised data do we store;</p>

    <ol>
        <li>When connecting a service of your choice (Discord, Github, Itch, etc.) we obtain your Unique User Id on that service. This User Id is anonymised through hashing and stored for means of verification.</li>
        <li>When connecting for the first time we create a user profile with the username and avatar of connected service.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Why do we store this data;</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Using the hashed Unique User Id of the connected services we can always guarantee we interact with the expected user.</li>
        <li>Your username and avatar is used to display your name and an image of your choice to identify you for other users.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Data Deletion</h1>

    <p>What do we delete when requested;</p>

    <ol>
        <li>We delete your username and avatar from our servers.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What data do we not delete;</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The hashed Unique User Id from the other services.</li>
        <li>Entries submitted</li>
        <li>Votes cast</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Why do we not delete the data;</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Because the Unique User Id is hashed it is no longer possible to trace back your details through that service. As such the hashed version of your Unique User Id is not deemed personalised data.</li>
        <li>By uploading you give us rights to use, distribute, alter, and display your content. This extends after your account is gone.</li>
        <li>Voting does not store personal data.</li>
    </ol>
