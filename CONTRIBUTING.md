# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. We will not merge changes that we do not approve of and we want to spare you the unnecessary work.

## Writing Code

When writing additional code, please ensure that you are modifying the core/existing functionality as little as possible to allow maintainability.

Please also make sure that your coding styles match the existing styles enforced by us. If we deem your style to be too different to ours we will let you know when going over your pull request.

Additionally, when making changes to styling on the website, please try to retain the visual style that is already set in place.

We kindly ask you to remain open for feedback from our side when creating a pull request.
