## Writing Code

VoteMyst is written in D. We try to maintain the standard D naming conventions throughout the projects and request that you try the same to ensure a consistent convention. Please refer to existing code for that matter and do not shy away from asking for feedback in your pull requests.

### Modifying existing code

If possible, try to keep existing code intact while making a change. We will approach changes to existing functionality in a more critical manner, to ensure breaking changes do not occur.

## Adding HTML/CSS content

If you add a new page or component to the project please try to stick to the styling conventions established by the other pages inside the project. For color choices, stick to the pre-defined CSS variables in `:root`. If you want to propose a new color variable to be added, do not hesitate to include it.
